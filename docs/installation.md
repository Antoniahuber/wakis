# âš¡ Installation guide

This section covers how to install `wakis` package for developers and users. 

The installation guide is writen for Linux, but `wakis` code and dependencies are 100% python so it can run in other operating systems. For developers using Windows, we recommend checking the [WSL setup guide](#WSL) to install and setup the Windows subsystem for linux.

## Installing from Github

### For users
`wakis` is now deployed to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wakis/) and can be installed through pip:
```
pip install wakis
```
You can also upgrade to the latest version frequently by doing `pip install wakis --upgrade`. 

To use `wakis` in python notebooks, the option `pip install wakis['notebook']` is preferred. See the section on [troubleshooting](#python-notebooks-troubleshooting) if an error pops up when rendering 3D plots.

### For developers
Wakis development is managed through [Wakis GitHub](https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/wakis). We encourage developers to use Github CLI from Windows/Linux. If you need to download it, refer to the official [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). To start using wakis and access the python scripts that compose the code, you can `git clone` it from the main repository:
```
# SSH:
git clone git@github.com:ImpedanCEI/wakis.git

# or HTTPS:
git clone https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/wakis.git
```

On a previously created conda environment, one can proceed installing the dependencies. On  `wakis` main directory do:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also pip install wakis on editable mode [RECOMMENDED]:
```
git clone git@github.com:ImpedanCEI/wakis.git
cd wakis
pip install -e .
```

If you would like to improve and push changes to `wakis`, we encorage to create a [fork](https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/wakis/fork) from wakis' `main` branch: https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/wakis on your personal GitHub. 

To contribute, first fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. Step-by-step:

1. Fork the repository: https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/wakis/fork
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
3. Make your changes and commit them:
    `git add my-changed-script.py`
    `git commit -m 'Explain the changes'`
4. Push to the branch: git push origin my-feature-branch
5. Submit a pull request: https://github.com/ImpedanCEI/wakis/pulls

## Dependencies

`wakis` is a 100% pyhton code that relies only on a few renowed python packages:

* `numpy`: Used for numerical operations, especially for matrix operations.
* `scipy`: Provides additional functionality for sparse matrices and other scientific computations.
* `matplotlib`: Used for 1d and 2d plotting and visualization.
* `h5py`: This package provides a Python interface to the HDF5 binary data format for storing the field 3D data for several timesteps
* `tqdm`: This package is used for displaying progress bars in loops.
* `pyvista`: For handling and visualizing 3D CAD geometries and vtk-based 3D plotting.

To install only the dependencies in a conda python environment, simply run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Python installation

If a python installation has not been setup yet, we recommend using [miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/) (free of license) or [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html) [^2]. 

Miniforge executable can be obtained from the website (Windows/Linux) [https://conda-forge.org/download/](https://conda-forge.org/download/), or from the terminal (Linux):

```
# get, install and activate miniforge
wget "https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh"
bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh
conda activate
```

Miniconda can also be installed and activated from the terminal:

```
# get, install and activate miniconda
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh 
source miniconda3/bin/activate
```

We encourage the users to create a dedicated python environment with python <=3.11, >=3.9
```
# create dev python environment
conda create --name wakis-env python=3.11
conda activate wakis-env

# pip install wakis and other useful packages
pip install wakis                # minimal installation for scripts
pip install wakis['notebook']    # complete installation for notebook use 
pip install bihc neffint iddefix # optional satellite packages
```

## GPU setup
`wakis` uses `cupy` to access GPU acceleration with the supported NVIDIA GPUs (more info in [Cupy's website](https://cupy.dev/)).
Provided a compatible [NVIDIA CUDA GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) or [AMD ROCm GPUs](https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/desktops/radeon.html) with the adequate drivers & Toolkit, one can install `cupy` from pip:
```
# For CUDA 11.2 ~ 11.x
pip install cupy-cuda11x

# For CUDA 12.x
pip install cupy-cuda12x

# For AMD ROCm 4.3
pip install cupy-rocm-4-3

# For AMD ROCm 5.0
pip install cupy-rocm-5-0
```
Or go for a `conda-forge` installation of both cupy and the CUDA Toolkit (RECOMMENDED):

```
conda install -c conda-forge cupy cuda-version=11.8
```

The toolkits can be installed using `conda`, `conda-forge`, `mamba` or from the source. Notice the version compatibility between GPU drivers and Toolkit to [choose the adequate version](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/latest/reference/support-matrix.html):
```
# Conda alternative [RECOMENDED]
conda install cudatoolkit cuda-version=11 # for cuda 11.xx
conda install cuda-cudart cuda-version=12 # for cuda 12.xx

# Mamba alternative
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
mamba install cudatoolkit=11.8.0
```

You can find the official CUDA Toolkit in the [NVIDIA development website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Fedora&target_version=41&target_type=rpm_local)

## Python Notebooks troubleshooting

### Matplotlib interactive plots
Within jupyter notebooks, in order to be able to zoom and interact with matplotlib figures, one needs to use notebook magic commands `%`. 
* The recommended one for Jupyter notebooks on the web is `%matplotlib widget`
* The recommended one for Jupyter notebooks on VS Code in `%matplotlib ipympl`

The package `ipympl`can be easily installed using `pip install ipympl`

### PyVista interactive plots
To be able to render 3D interactive plots in Jupyter notebooks, it is recommended to use the `wakis['notebook']` pip installation. 

Some driver problems may arise depending on pre-installed versions. One way of solving common errors like `MESA-loader` or `libGL error` is installing a new driver within your conda environment with:

```
conda install conda-forge::libstdcxx-ng
```

If you're in a headless environment (e.g., remote server, openstack machine), forcing OSMesa (Off-Screen Mesa) rendering might help:

```python
import os
os.environ['PYVISTA_USE_OSMESA'] = 'True'
```

## MPI setup
To run multi-CPU parallelized simulations, Wakis needs the following packages:

* OpenMPI installed in your operating system:
* Python package [`mpi4py`](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
* Python package [`ipyparallel`](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/intro.html) to start a MPI kernel inside notebooks

The preferred install method is through `conda-forge`:

```
# All at once [recommended]
conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py openmpi
```

In case openmpi fails, sometimes installing them separately helps:

```bash
# Conda forge openmpi
conda install -c conda-forge openmpi

# Check install
which mpicc #/usr/bin/mpicc
which mpiexec #/usr/bin/mpiexec

# Conda forge mpi4py
conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py

# For working on jupyter notebooks:
pip install ipyparallel
```

Alternatively, for sudo users, installation through `apt`+`pip` has also proven to work:
```bash
# sudo alternative (ubuntu)
sudo apt update
sudo sudo apt install openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev
# mpi4py through pip
CC=mpicc pip install --no-cache-dir mpi4py
# For working on jupyter notebooks:
pip install ipyparallel
```

* `OpenMPI` is built in Linux with multi-GPU compatibility (provided `cupy` is correctly setup):
```bash
# To check CUDA-aware ompi, try:
ompi_info --parsable | grep mpi_built_with_cuda_support 
# output should be: 
# mca:mpi:base:param:mpi_built_with_cuda_support:value:true

# Alternatively, try:
ompi_info | grep -i cuda
# output should contain: 
# MPI extensions: affinity, cuda, pcollreq
```
Before launching an MPI simulation, make sure to set the environment variable `OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support` to `true`:

```bash
# Set environment variable to use CUDA-aware before launching your MPI processes
export OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support=true
```

To run MPI simulations from the terminal:
```bash
# multi CPU
mpiexec -n 8 python your_wakis_cpu_script.py

# multi GPU
mpiexec --mca btl_smcuda_cuda_ipc_max 0 -n 4 python your_wakis_gpu_script.py
# or:
mpiexec --mca opal_cuda_support 1 -n 4 python your_wakis_gpu_script.py
```

[PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista) a python package for 3D plotting and mesh analysis through a streamlined interface for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) [^1]. 
We rely on [PyVista](https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista) to import CAD/STL geometry as embedded boundaries or/and as solids with different materials into the domain. This allows `wakis` to efficiently render 3D plots of the electromagnetic fields and visualize the computational mesh interactively.
